Some notes as I work with these pathway files:

* the original file pid_123_pathway.tab contained the edge
  PER1-2 / CRY1-2  BMAL1/CLOCK  -t>
  This seems nonsensical. Both entities are complexes, and hence
  the -t> flag (transcriptional promotion) doesn't seem applicable.
  I've deleted this edge (there was already the equivalent -a> edge,
  which I have left in place).
* the original file pid_2_pathway.tab contained the edges
  VHL  VEGFA homodimer  -t|
  HIF1A/ARNT  VEGFA homodimer  -t|
  Which are similarly nonsensical. I replaced them with
  corresponding -a| edges.
